Note on redTS Python module.

Redrpm provide a Subset of original rpmts Python mapping for LibRPM.
This subset should contains every methods used by DNF redpak version.

Would rpmLib maintainers make public the rpmts objects, reserve a free void* handle in rpmts
and ship rpmlib Python/C glue as a shared library and not a close module, that most of this
code could be made obsolete.

- rpmlib-ori: contains 100% unmodified code from RPMlib/Python
- redts-import: unmodified functions extracted from original rpmts and rpmmodule LibRpm
- redtd-main: contains every Python module and object initialisation
  outside of some changes in name/class, most of the code remains unchanged from LibRpm
- redts-glue: contains methods where logic was change to support redpak module

In general redTS and original rpmTS are 99% identical. But as today it is impossible to
complement librpm python glue without duplicating most of the code.

 - rpmts_xxxx should be unmodified from original code
 - redts_xxxx have been modified

Evil is in details :)
